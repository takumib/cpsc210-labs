## Objectives

Throughout the semester we've relied on several useful tools such as 
makefiles to ease the development of our programs. 

The objective of this lab is to better understand how some of these tools 
work. To do this we'll demonstrate how to write makefiles of your own and
debug your programs with a combination of print statements and conditional 
compilation. Lab will conclude with a brief tutorial/walkthrough on 
GDB (a dedicated debugging tool). 

This lab will be a guided one. This handout is merely intended to serve as a 
summary/reference. 

### Part #1: writing a simple power function

This program consists of two pieces: 
* `my_math.h`: the header file containing the prototype of our `my_pow()` 
function.
* `my_math.c`: the iterative implementation of the function.

### Part #2: compiling with gcc


### Part #3: debugging with print statements

### Part #4: compiling with make

### Part #5: introduction to debugging with GDB
