## Objectives

To gain more experience working with classes and objects in C++, in this lab you will
will re-architect the `vector` library you developed in C earlier in the semester, only 
this time taking advantage of the encapsulation and abstraction that classes and objects
allow.

In addition to gaining more experience with object-oriented programming, this lab will 
also introduce you to a powerful C++ feature referred to as *operator overloading*.

## Task #1: thinking in terms of objects

Unlike our last go around with this library in C, we won't be representing a `vector`
as a struct, but instead with a class.

INLINE method

##Task #1: complete `vector.h`

Like our last go-around with this library in C, our first task is figuring out how best 
to represent the core notion of a `vector` in C++. 

### 
#debris

which will allow you to write 
which will allow you to express the various operations provided by your library in a 
much more natural way.
