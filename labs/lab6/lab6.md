When you're finished, and you are confident your work is *adequately commented* and 
*correct*, go ahead and 'tarify' with the following command:
```
tar cvf lab6_handin.tar list.h list.c iterator.c iterator.h main.c MakeFile
```
and submit the resulting `lab6_handin.tar` to the appropriate bucket on 
[handin](https://handin.cs.clemson.edu/courses/).
