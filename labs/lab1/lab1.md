## Objectives

In this lab we're going to dive head first into the unix environment and (hopefully!)
begin to grok some of the following concepts:

* login
* terminal usage: including four key commands
* 
* using **gcc** to compile simple programs

## Resources



## Lab execution and handin

Assuming you are in the correct directory, all you need to do is type `make` followed by
`./lab5` to run the `listtest` driver. 

When you're finished, and you are confident your work is *adequately commented* and 
*correct*, go ahead and 'tarify' with the following command:
```
tar cvf lab5_handin.tar list.h list.c listtest.c MakeFile
```
and submit the resulting `lab5_handin.tar` to the appropriate bucket on 
[handin](https://handin.cs.clemson.edu/courses/).
