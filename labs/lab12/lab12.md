## Objectives

Building on our shape hierarchy built up in previous labs, in this lab we'll conclude the 
semester working with this hierarchy using references 

## Testing

To compile and test your code type this:

```c++
g++ -Wall main.cpp shape.cpp rectangle.cpp circle.cpp rightTriangle.cpp -o lab11
./lab11
```

**Remember**: This will not work until you have created workable code for `rightTriangle.cpp`.

## Handin

To hand in your project use the *tar czvf* command to turn in all of your `.cpp` and `.h` files and name the file `lab11_handin.tar.gz`. Use the [handin](http://handin.cs.clemson.edu/courses) website to turn in your lab 11.
