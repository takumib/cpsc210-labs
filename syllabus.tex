\section{Objectives}
There are several objectives to this lab. First, you will gain experience using
{\em abstract classes} to simplify application construction. Second, you will
gain additional experience applying the {\em Template Method} pattern. Third, you will
gain additional experience using Java {\em inheritance}. Finally, (the moment
you've all been waiting for), you will be introduced to the {\em Swing} class
library.

\section{Overview}
For this lab, you will implement a simple GUI application using the Java Swing
library. The application will display a window that contains a list of contacts
organized in a table. Each row will correspond to a single contact, with
columns corresponding to the contact's first name, last name, email address,
and favorite color. The first three columns will display simple text strings.
The final column will use a custom rendering component to fill the table cell
based on the contact's favorite color.
